Handwriting is a unique characteristic that distinguishes a person's identity and serves as a method for identifying various physical and psychological attributes of the writer. It reflects genuine personality traits, including behavior, emotional responses, self-perception, creativity, honesty, fears, and many other characteristics. In this paper, we propose a multi-layered approach for analyzing personality traits through handwriting analysis, utilizing a Voting Classifier, which integrates predictions from multiple base models to enhance overall performance. Specifically, our Voting Classifier combines Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier. Each base model is carefully tuned using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters such as regularization strength for Logistic Regression, kernel type for Support Vector Machine, and number of estimators for Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Classifiers. The model's performance evaluation reveals impressive results, with a 93% accuracy in classifying handwriting samples. These findings highlight the model's effectiveness and its ability to handle various handwriting styles with consistency. The strong accuracy underscores the model's potential for real-world applications, offering trustworthy insights into personality traits through handwriting analysis.
